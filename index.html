        <p>British chemist Rosalind Elsie Franklin was born into an affluent and influential Jewish family on July 25, 1920, in Notting Hill, London, England. She displayed exceptional intelligence from early childhood, knowing from the age of 15 that she wanted to be a scientist. She received her education at several schools, including North London Collegiate School, where she excelled in science, among other things.</p>

          <p>She was an English chemist and X-ray crystallographer who made contributions to the understanding of the molecular structures of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), RNA (ribonucleic acid), viruses, coal, and graphite. Studying DNA structure with X-ray diffraction, Franklin and her student Raymond Gosling made an amazing discovery: They took pictures of DNA and discovered that there were two forms of it, a dry "A" form and a wet "B" form. One of their X-ray diffraction pictures of the "B" form of DNA, known as Photograph 51, became famous as critical evidence in identifying the structure of DNA.</p>

        <p>Rosalind Franklin was a gifted student and excelled in science, Latin, and sports. She matriculated in 1938 and earned six distinctions and a scholarship to college. Her mentor there was Ronald Norrish, the winner of the 1967 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. She also pioneered work on the molecular structure of tobacco mosaic virus and the polio virus.</p>
